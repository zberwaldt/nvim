# My Nvim Config.

This is my current nvim set up for nvim.

First off, this depends on version 0.9.x of nvim.

Second, I must have packer installed before hand!

Read the quickstart on the packer git [README](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart)

Last, This guide assumes a Linux based system.

1. Clone this repo into your `.config/` directory.
2. Open `nvim` 
3. Run `:PackerSync`

That should do it!
